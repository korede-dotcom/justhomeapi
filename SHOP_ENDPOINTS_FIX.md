# üîß Shop Endpoints Fix - PATCH & DELETE Now Working

## ‚úÖ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: PATCH and DELETE endpoints for shops were returning 404 errors
**Root Cause**: Missing controller methods in `ShopController`
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **What Was Fixed**

### **Added Missing Controller Methods**

Added the following endpoints to `src/shop/shop.controller.ts`:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
@Roles('CEO', 'Admin', 'Storekeeper', 'Receptionist', 'Packager', 'Attendee')
findOne(@Param('id') id: string) {
  return this.shopService.findOne(id);
}

@Patch(':id')
@Roles('CEO', 'Admin')
update(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() data: any) {
  return this.shopService.update(id, data);
}

@Delete(':id')
@Roles('CEO', 'Admin')
remove(@Param('id') id: string) {
  return this.shopService.remove(id);
}
```

### **Enhanced Service Methods**

Improved `src/shop/shop.service.ts` with proper relations:

```typescript
// Enhanced findAll with full relations
async findAll() {
  return this.prisma.shop.findMany({
    include: {
      manager: { select: { id: true, username: true, fullName: true, role: true } },
      users: { select: { id: true, username: true, fullName: true, role: true } },
      productAssignments: {
        include: { product: { include: { category: true } } }
      },
      _count: { select: { users: true, productAssignments: true } }
    }
  });
}

// Enhanced findOne with full relations
async findOne(id: string) {
  const shop = await this.prisma.shop.findUnique({
    where: { id },
    include: {
      manager: { select: { id: true, username: true, fullName: true, role: true } },
      users: { select: { id: true, username: true, fullName: true, role: true } },
      productAssignments: {
        include: { product: { include: { category: true } } }
      }
    }
  });
  if (!shop) throw new NotFoundException('Shop not found');
  return shop;
}
```

## ‚úÖ **VERIFICATION: ALL ROUTES NOW MAPPED**

```
[RoutesResolver] ShopController {/shops}:
‚úÖ Mapped {/shops, POST} route           - Create shop
‚úÖ Mapped {/shops, GET} route            - List all shops  
‚úÖ Mapped {/shops/:id, GET} route        - Get shop by ID (NEW!)
